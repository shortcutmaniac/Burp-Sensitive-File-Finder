# Burp-Sensitive-File-Finder

This was mainly for Burp Enterprise because there is no "Discover Content" like in Burp Professional. But in order to enumerate Files/Paths with a scan in Burp Enterprise i wrote this Java plugin. I used this fuzzing list: https://github.com/Karanxa/Bug-Bounty-Wordlists/blame/main/fuzz.txt

just:
gradle build
gradle fatjar
import your .jar file from the lib folder


You can also find a Pre Compiled Jar here.
